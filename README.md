# Reverse engineering of the "Light fantastic" experiment's software

Here are my notes for my ongoing reverse-engineering of the C64 programs for the "Light fantastic" experiment.

"Light fantastic" was a broadcasting experiment in the 1985 British TV show "4 Computer Buffs" during which
programs for home computers were transmitted as part of the TV signal, encoded in a blinking dot on the screen.

Further information about the experiment and attempts at reproducing it can be found in the following:

# Summary

I've disassembled the tuning and receiver programs for C64. Strangely, the
receiver program looks incomplete. Here's how it basically works:

HW: The multivibrator is used to lengthen the pulses read by the
phototransistor in order to bridge the gap between TV fields (50 Hz "half-frames"). The tuning
procedure tells you to adjust the timing of the circuit such that the
lengthening of the pulses is just enough so the user port signal (PB7) never
goes to LOW if a bright square is displayed under the sensor.

Tuning program: It displays a bright square and then just checks if it ever
reads PB7 as LOW. If so, it puts an asterisk '*' between the arrows. (You can
clear the asterisk by pressing a key.) If the asterisk does no longer show up,
it means PB7 is reading HIGH each time it is sampled.

Receiver program: It first waits for a keypress. Then it waits for the bright
square to *dis*appear (i.e. the first start bit). Each byte is transmitted as a '0'
start bit and then 8 data bits with hard-coded timing. Then there is a short
gap (stop bit(s)). The program then synchronizes again to the start bit of the next byte. All
the timing and reading loops are there, but strangely, my disassembly seems to
be missing the part that actually stores the transmitted data in memory.

The receiver is designed to read a tokenized BASIC program into memory. For the C64,
it reads tokenized BASIC lines until a $0000 in the first two bytes of a tokenized
line signals the end of the program.

# Protocol

Bytes are transmitted as 9 bits (a fixed '0' start bit and then 8 data bits).
After each byte there is a little gap that could be interpreted as "don't care" stop bit(s).
They are not sampled by the receiver program. However, the transmission must go HIGH again
(i.e. bright square) after each byte before the receiver starts sampling again, so the receiver
can synchronize to the next start bit (transition HIGH -> LOW, i.e. bright -> dark).
In this sense the stop bit(s) must be '1'.

Bits are sent LSB first. (Each bit, after having been received, is rotated into the 'A' register using ROR,
which means bits enter the MSB of A and then move down to the right. So the first bit received this way
ends up in the LSB of 'A' when all bits of the byte have been received. The start bit is shifted out
of 'A' when the last data bit is shifted in.)

The overall protocol for receiving bytes seems to work like this (it is meant to read a tokenized BASIC program):

- main loop:
    - read 2 bytes (start address of next BASIC line); if both are zero (end of program), then quit
    - read 2 bytes (the tokenized line number, any values)
    - read 1..n zero-terminated bytes (including the zero byte) (this reads one tokenized BASIC line)
    - repeat main loop

# Bit timing

Bit timing within a byte is hard-coded in the receiver program by running a fixed number of iterations
of the delay loops.

A very rough estimate of the bit time, not considering bad lines or time spent outside of the delay routine:

On a PAL C64:

30 * 124 iterations of the delay loop = 18733 cycles = 18733 / (17.734475 MHz / 18) = 18733 * 1.015 Âµs = about 19 ms per bit

Considering some additional time spent outside of the delay code, this lines up with a bit time of ~20 ms, i.e. a bit frequency of 50 Hz, or one bit per TV field.

# Expected signal for the C64 program

Since the transmitted program is a tokenized BASIC program that will be placed at the default location
for BASIC programs on the C64 (starting at memory address $0801) and the first two bytes contain the address of the
next BASIC line (i.e. of the second line of the program), we can expect the following:

If the first line of the program uses strictly less than the maximum of 255 bytes (which is very likely), then
the second line will start at an address of the form $08xx, therefore the second byte of the transmission is
expected to be $08.

$08 is transmitted as (LSB first) 0001 0000. Including a start bit (0) and one or two stop bits (1), one of the following
patterns is expected at the start of the transmission:

For one stop bit per byte:

    ...111 (0) **** **** (10) 0001 0000 (1)

For two stop bits per byte:

    ...111 (0) **** **** (110) 0001 0000 (11)

where

    1         denotes 20 ms of a field with a bright dot
    0         denotes 20 ms of a field with darkness
    ...111    denotes the continuously bright dot before the transmission of the first byte
    *         denotes 20 ms of an unknown bit value in the first transmitted byte
    ( )       parentheses mark start and stop bits

    Note: Spaces are just for readability.

Using a video player with the capability to step through the fields of an interlaced video,
it should therefore be possible to check whether the expected signal is present.

# Missing code

In the receiver program, there are JSRs (subroutine calls) to the address $C075.
The code expected at that address seems to be responsible for processing the
bytes received from the TV. However, the published C64 program ends exactly
before this address!

From context and from looking at the BBC receiver program, the missing subroutine at $C075 should do the following:

- store the byte in register A into the byte pointed to by zeropage[$FD]:zeropage[$FC]
- increment the pointer zeropage[$FD]:zeropage[$FC]
- return, with the read byte still in register A

# Example of completed receiver program by nc513

For an example of a complete receiver program for the C64, see the file `C000_C64REC_nc513.prg`. This program was posted
to the lemon64 thread by user nc513 on Aug 8, 2024, independent from my reverse engineering. It contains the following
additions to the originally published C64 receiver program:

- (at $C07D) the subroutine for storing the received byte and incrementing the running pointer (zeropage[$FD]:zeropage[$FC]),
- (at $C043) after having received the end of the transmission and before exiting, the program sets the `VARTAB` pointer (zeropage[$2E]:zeropage[$$2D]) to the first byte beyond the received program code.

See `c64_receiver_program_by_nc513_disassembly.txt` for an (uncommented) disassembly of this program.

Note: I am not sure whether setting `VARTAB` suffices for establishing a valid BASIC interpreter state after
downloading the transmitted program.

# Receiver program for BBC Micro

The receiver program for the BBC Micro is very similar to the one for C64 but it looks complete.
In particular, it does include the subroutine for storing the received bytes.

However, the protocol for determining when the transmission is over is different in the BBC receiver, due to the different format of tokenized BASIC lines on the BBC Micro.

The BBC protocol seems to work like this:

- read the first byte (the leading #$0D of the first tokenized line)
- main loop:
    - read a byte (this should be the high byte of a tokenized line number)
    - if the byte has bit 7 set, then quit
    - read a byte (this should be the low byte of a tokenized line number)
    - read a sequence of 1..n bytes, terminated by #$0D (carriage return; which is also stored)
    - repeat main loop

This protocol is meant to read a tokenized BASIC program. Each line starts with a #$0D character,
followed by two bytes for the line number. If the line number is >= 32768 unsigned ($8000), the receiver stops.

The program `C000_C64REC_nc513.prg` was independently assembled and uploaded to lemon64 by user nc513. See the thread https://www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1027686 on Aug 8, 2024.
